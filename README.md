## Inspiration

It took a lot of time and effort to build this but actually if you have the best API and resources, we could build the app within 7 days. What inspired me to build this one was that, To showcase my app and share to others, I constantly used many screenshot chrome extention, mainly [Scrn.li](http://scrnli.com/install-app). But, Still I faced many difficulties that is, There is big need to show others that our app is responsive over many devices, as a proof we take screenshot of mobile sizes and that is really a difficult task to take mobile screenshots on Laptop.

But Sadly,
**There are no Chrome Extentions that offer you to take screenshot over different devices**

And that is where the Idea came up and that end in the development of XShot. Xshot does all the Job. 

## What it does
XShot is a simple, easier, fast, minimal Screenshot taking chrome extention. Some Extrordinary features like taking screenshots from different devices like **Phone**, **Laptop**, **Tablet** make the app totally different and powerful from Others. Here are the awesome features of the app, more are on the way!

1. Take Screenshots as a **mobile device**
1. Take Screenshots as a **tablet device**
1. Take **Visible Page Screenshots**
1. Take Awesome **Full Page Screenshots**
1. Take Screenshots with **Browser mockup**
1. Minimal **Soft UI**
1. **Fast** and **Efficient**
1. Ability **Choose Background Color** for Mockup
1. Forever **Opensource**
1. **New Features** are on the way

## Install Chrome Extention
Currently, I haven't hosted the extention on Chrome Web Store, but you can expect it after the development is fully complete.

If you're interested you could use it by following the [INSTALL_EXTENTION.md](https://github.com/divyaxavier/SmartQR/blob/main/extention/INSTALL_EXTENTION.md). Thanks

## How I built it
To build the extention, the most time consumed step was to find the best and the productive API to make the extention work. After finding the API, I started creating a UI for the extention and then coded it. After that I developed a website with Soft UI to showcase the project.

## Challenges I ran into
I was hit by a lot of error and challenges. The most hard one was that the API was not working correctly as per my need. Literally I have gone through more that 20 APIs from the Internet and tried over 7 of the best one and at last I ended up on this API. I got to find the my code not working, I cried to the devs of staoverflow and they helped, I asked my friend the difficulties they face to get Ideas. It took much time to make all the awesome features and making it work. I had to spend many time to make the website fully responsive. I too had to struggle with the color and UI for the app. Finally, I did it.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am really proud that I did coded a very productive, unique chrome extention that have many extraordinary features. This the biggest, productive chrome extention that I have ever developed.  

## What I learned
Actually I have so happy that I have learned to use differnt APIs and libraries. I was mainly working on CSS and Javascript, But this project helped me to go deep into the topic. I watched many tutorials on Youtube to solve my many errors.

## What's next for SmartQR
